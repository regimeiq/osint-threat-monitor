# SITREP (Synthetic)

Generated: synthetic fixture workflow (`make demo`)
Classification: Synthetic/Unclassified

## Summary
Cross-domain correlation surfaced an elevated protective-intelligence thread linking insider telemetry, external signal activity, and third-party vendor exposure.

## Key Facts
- subject pivot: `EMP-7415`
- vendor pivot: `sc-004`
- thread confidence: high (synthetic fixture scenario)
- principal risk: potential insider-enabled data staging/exfil pathway

## Current Assessment
Credible convergence indicators justify immediate escalation and controlled mitigation actions.

## Immediate Actions
1. Enforce temporary access constraints on implicated identities/systems.
2. Escalate to protective detail lead and intelligence manager.
3. Preserve event/provenance artifacts for investigative continuity.
